# Abdalla_Ibarra_Stark_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Our group is going to develop a hangman game. This game is going to consist of a notepad in which many common words will be stored. The program will then choose a random word from the notepad. The game will also have ASCII art to display the hangman and the blank spaces for the word. The user will then begin inputting letters and the program will run through the letters of the word to determine if the letter is valid or not. The game will continue this process untill either the word is completed or the man is complete.
